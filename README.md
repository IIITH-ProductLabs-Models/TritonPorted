**Bhashini Translational Models**


Different types of models shared as a part of the Bhashini program have been ported to Triton by BEU.

The Triton ported, unoptimized ASR and OCR are presented in this repository, in their respective files.

Each of these models are accompanied by their checkpoint files and inference files that can be used to host and run the models.
